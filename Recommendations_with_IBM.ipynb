Since the new user has not yet interacted with any articles, we would not have any information about their preferences or similarities to other users.\n",

For example, we could recommend popular articles or articles related to a particular topic or keyword that the user is interested in. This approach does not require any user-item interactions and is therefore suitable for new users.\n",

For example, we could use the content of articles to recommend similar articles to the ones the user has shown interest in, and then use collaborative filtering to recommend articles that similar users have interacted with. This approach can be particularly effective for new users who do not yet have a lot of interaction data available, as it can leverage both the content of articles and the behavior of similar users to make recommendations."

The plot shows that the model is overfitting to the train set as the number of latent features increases, and that the performance on the test set is not improving. To evaluate the performance of the recommendation systems, we could conduct A/B testing and measure engagement metrics such as click-through rate or time spent on the site. We could also conduct user studies or surveys to gather feedback from users on the quality and relevance of the recommendations. These approaches would help us identify areas for improvement and guide the development of new recommendation systems."
